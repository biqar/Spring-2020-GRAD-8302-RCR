# Developing a Well-Reasoned Response to a Moral Problem in Scientific Research1

### Problem Statement

```
Trouble in the Lab

Sarah Straight is a fourth-year graduate student in the lab of Professor Stressig. She is completing her graduate research in preparation to defend her dissertation, but has been a very distracted by concerns that Stressig is pursuing a romantic relationship  with another graduate student in the lab, Cary Shuld, who is relatively new to the lab and shows great potential.
 
Straight has not confronted Stressig about her concerns nor otherwise shared her concerns with the Department Chair.  She fears that sharing her concerns or reporting them may adversely impact her dissertation progress.  If an investigation is launched, it could require removal of her advisor from the lab for months, if not permanently, depending on the findings.  She also doesn't know if she has enough information to go forward, though she has noticed that Cary appears more reticent, recently, to visit the lab, and is falling behind on her research.
 
Should Sarah bring her concerns to the department chair? Why or why not?
Please apply Babeau's four criteria for making well-reasoned responses to moral problems in your response.
