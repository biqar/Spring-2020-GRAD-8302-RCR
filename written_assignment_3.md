## Identifying conflicts-of-interest

### Problem Statement

```
Big Ambitions University recently announced a five-year campaign to raise 500 million dollars. 
A local donor in the trucking industry was successfully courted by the University president, to 
donate $50 million toward the development of a research center that would be built on land donated 
by the donor. Shortly before announcing the donation, the donor sponsored a research grant to fund 
emissions research to be conducted by a team of Big Ambition researchers, one of whom had, on 
occasion, served as an independent contractor, advising the donor on its compliance with emissions 
regulations and fuel efficiency standards. This faculty member was identified as the Principal 
Investigator on the grant. The sponsored research focuses on (1) whether the engines used by the 
sponsor complied with current federal emissions standards, (2) the environmental impact of the 
engines, and (3) recommendation for industry optimization plans to address future environmental 
regulations.

Please identify any actual or potential conflicts of interest in this hypo. Please further advise 
regarding whether and how any such conflicts can be effectively managed and propose a management 
plan for the University's Research Compliance Office's consideration. If you do not believe any 
of the actual or potential conflicts can be effectively managed, please describe why.

### Response
In this hypo, I found two possible conflicts of interest. First, the company funds the research and is the research target at the same time. So, there is conflicts of interest related to research results and company reputation. Also, the company is going to donate $50 million toward the development of a research center to the University, thus could make influence the University authority regarding the research outcome. Second, the Principal Investigator of the research has a relationship with the company as an independent contractor. The relationship may act as a compromising factor for the faculty or staff memberâ€™s objectivity in carrying out his or her University responsibilities. 

The University policy encourages the faculty and stuffs to engage in appropriate outside research or non-research activity. It also mentions, outside activities and financial interests must be arranged so as not to interfere with the University commitments. I think University can effectively manage this situation in two different ways. First, the Principal Investigator of the research worked as an independent contractor earlier and it is not mentioned whether he is still involved with that company. If he/she does not involve with the company now, then it should not be an issue of conflict of interest. University authority may check whether the Principal Investigator is still in a personal relationship with the company, and if found true then may take legal actions. Second, as the University is taking a donation from the company, so the University authority may hire a third-party organization to audit the corresponding research related operations. If it is not possible, then the University may refuse the research grand as it may make conflict with the donation receive from the company.
