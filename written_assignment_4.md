## ICMJE guideline for honorary authorship

### Problem Statement

```
This is the last written assignment, before your final!  

As noted in your reading material, the ICMJE came up with guidelines for determining whether 
awarding authorship is appropriate. Per those guidelines, authorship credit is considered 
honorary if:
    1) An author did not meet these three criteria:
        (a) “conceiving and designing the work,” “analysing and interpreting the data,” or 
            “collecting data or other material” (we included data collection as an acceptable 
            criterion for authorship because the ICMJE had added this to their guidelines before 
            we conducted this study)
        (b) “writing the manuscript or part of the manuscript” or “revising the manuscript to 
            make important changes in content”
        (c) “approving the final version of the manuscript”
    2) An author did not “feel comfortable explaining the major conclusions” of the article
    3) An author performed “only one function, and nothing else” from a list of 17 activities: 
        (a) supervising the work of any of the coauthors;
        (b) recruiting coauthors;
        (c) recruiting study subjects;
        (d) analyzing or interpreting data;
        (e) conducting literature search;
        (f) analyzing or interpreting literature;
        (g) reviewing the manuscript;
        (h) communicating with journal editor(s);
        (i) signing the statement of copyright transfer to the journal;
        (j) conceiving and designing the work;
        (k) collecting data and other material;
        (l) obtaining funding or material support;
        (m) performing statistical analysis;
        (n) writing the manuscript or part of the manuscript;
        (o) approving the manuscript before submission to a journal;
        (p) revising the manuscript or making important changes in content;
        (q) reviewing page proofs or the journal’s edited version of the manuscript 
            (see questions 8, 9, and revised question 11 in the study questionnaire on bmj.com).

Your writing should cover the following:
    (i) Please share your thoughts on the criteria ICMJE has established and whether you 
        believe they are appropriate.  
    (ii) Why is honorary authorship an ethical issue?  Please explain how awarding unmerited 
        authorship erodes research integrity.
    (iii) If your supervisor asked you to name him or her as first author despite minimum 
        contribution, how would you respond? What is your recourse at UNC Charlotte when 
        a supervisor makes such a request?

### Response
The ICMJE guideline is set of recommendation produced by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for standardizing the ethics and regulations regarding the submission of the manuscript in biomedical journals. It includes guideline for honorary authorship credit. The guideline is meant to apply in biomedical research, but as a Computer Science PhD student, I will discuss my thoughts on this criterion from the perspective of my research domain.

First, ICMJE guideline suggests an authorship credit as honorary if an author did not “feel comfortable explaining the major conclusions” of the article. I think this point will be too strict for the young researchers, especially for the undergraduate level. To me, we should consider instead of the whole research, whether the researcher “feel comfortable explaining the major conclusions” of his part w.r.t the whole research. By this way, we could involve people who can make contributions to the very specific part of the research. Also, I think if anyone involve in a single task like conceiving and designing the work, collecting data and other material, or performing statistical analysis, etc. should be considered for honorary authorship. These tasks are sometimes considered as the key part of the research. For example, there is a research paper in Computer Science domain named “What is Twitter, a social network or a news media?” is cited by 7579 (Source: Google Scholar, last accessed in April 16, 2020). Most of the citations were for their tweeter dataset that is required for performance analysis of graph storage and algorithms. My point is, data collection sometimes demands a huge amount of work and may considered as the most impactful contribution of the whole project.

I think honorary authorship is not an unethical issue, as sometimes it is too difficult to measure someone’s contributions by-laws. Very little contribution including bug fix, literature review may bring up some major contribution in the research. For example, in my last semester a researcher in our lab fix a single line of code that helped us to achieve the expected result. But, awarding unmerited authorship sometime erodes research integrity. People who put major contribution may frustrate. Even sometimes monetary issues become involved in the research. Though ICMJE suggest to acknowledge non-author contributions individually or together as a group under a single heading (e.g. “Acknowledgements”), and their contributions should be specified (e.g. “for insightful discussions”, “helpful comments”, “performing benchmarking”, etc.).

If my supervisor asked me to name him or her as first author despite minimum contribution, I will first go through careful evaluation regarding my supervisor’s contribution. If I think his/her decision is wrong, I will try to discuss with him/her regarding my evaluation and judgement of his/her proposal. After that, if I still feel uncomfortable, I will make contact with my department’s chair and submit a petition to UNC Charlotte Research Integrity Officer (RIO).
