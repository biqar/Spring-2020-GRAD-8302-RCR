## Inquiry Report

### Problem Statement

```
On March 31st, the RIO received an email from Dr. Konfliktus, a Professor in the Department of 
Forest Ecology, alleging that his colleague in the Department, Dr. Murky, had violated the 
university’s research misconduct policy by:

(1) Failing to acknowledge the extensive contributions of collaborators, including Dr. Konfliktus, 
in several of his publications regarding bird habitat; and

(2) Making inaccurate representations in publications and recorded interviews about the source of 
recordings he made, pursuant to an NSF-funded grant, which recordings he alleged evidenced a 
decline in bird diversity in a forest that had undergone clearcutting in the last year. 

According to Dr. Konfliktus, Dr. Murky purported to have taken recordings of the same forest one 
year before and one year after clearcutting.  The recordings played by Dr. Murky in support of 
his findings in recorded interviews with Dr. Murky were profoundly different.  The recording that 
Dr. Murky said he took before clearcutting was a cacophonous mix of multiple bird songs, while there 
was hardly a peep to be heard in the second recording.

Dr. Konfliktus alleges that the recording allegedly taken after clearcutting must have been taken 
from another location because a train whistle could be heard in the background, and the location 
Dr. Murky purported to be recording was too far away from railroad tracks for that to be possible.

The RIO determined that at least some of the alleged acts could constitute research misconduct, 
if substantiated.  The RIO then immediately sequestered relevant electronic records by placing 
a hold on all Dr. Murky’s electronic files.  He also met with Dr. Murky to let him know about 
the complaint and advised him of the need to gather additional evidence, including all publications 
in which he had collaborated with Dr. Konfliktus and the underlying data and related communications 
from collaborators.  He also sought all data underlying the NSF funded study regarding bird diversity 
after clear cutting. 

At the time of the meeting, Dr. Murky let the RIO know he would provide the recordings if he could, 
but had misplaced them recently.  He assured the RIO that he had taken both recordings from the same 
location, and shared an online map of the site, which demonstrated proximity of a train track.  He 
also shared that Dr. Konfliktus had recently received a grant from the timber company that was 
responsible for the clearcutting. He suspected that the company funded Dr. Konfliktus’ research in 
hopes of countering Dr. Murky’s findings, because the company has suffered severe PR setbacks in the 
community since Dr. Murky’s research was published.  Dr. Murky shared a copy of a newspaper article 
reporting substantial layoffs at the timber company.

Because the RIO determined that at least some of the allegations could constitute a research 
misconduct violation, he established an inquiry committee to review the allegations.  You have 
been selected as the chair of the committee and have just completed a review of the foregoing 
information with your colleagues on the committee.  The committee has also interviewed Dr. Konfliktus 
and Dr. Murky.  During Dr. Konfliktus’ interview, he confirmed that he had received a small grant 
from a timber company.  He shared the grant documents, which indicated that the timber company was 
not the same company that had undertaken the clearcutting that was the subject of Dr. Murky’s research. 
However, he also confirmed that the company was interested in his evaluating the accuracy of 
Dr. Murky’s representations about the impact of clearcutting on forest species diversity.

Dr. Murky was still unable to locate the recordings at the time of his interview with the committee. 
Dr. Murky was similarly unable to provide the RIO or the committee with the underlying research data 
and communications for the publications he had collaborated on with Dr. Konfliktus.  Although he 
conceded being very poorly organized, he strongly disputed any wrong-doing.  He shared the map he 
had shared with the RIO, evidencing the proximity of the relevant location to train tracks, and he 
also shared videos of his interviews in which he discussed and played the now-missing recordings.

You have been asked to draft an Inquiry Report.  The report should address the following:

 (1) Whether Dr. Konfliktus has alleged acts that, if substantiated, may violate the research 
 misconduct policy. (Please specifically identify the type of research misconduct alleged and 
 also address whether or in what circumstances failure to acknowledge the contribution of 
 collaborators in a publication may constitute research misconduct under UNC Charlotte’s policy.)
 (2) Whether and how Dr. Konfliktus’ receipt of research funding from a timber company impacts your analysis.
 (3) Whether you believe the matter should be referred to a full investigation and the reasons for 
 your determination.

Please draft your Inquiry Report consistent with the guidelines provided previously, but included 
again for your reference below.

As noted in class, it is less important whether you recommend the matter for full investigation 
than it is to demonstrate an understanding of the applicable standards that apply to the review, 
including, for example, the applicable definition/s of research misconduct from UNC Charlotte’s 
Research Misconduct Policy, an understanding of the type of research misconduct at issue in this 
scenario, and the applicable evidentiary standard that applies at the Inquiry phase.

Please limit the report to three pages, using 12 point Times New Roman font.

### Response
#### Introduction
Dr. Konfliktus, Professor in the Department of Forest Ecology made an allegation of research misconduct on Dr. Murky, who is also a faculty member of the Department of Forest Ecology. Dr. Konfliktus alleged that Dr. Murky had violated the university’s research misconduct policy by:
1.	Dr. Murky failed to acknowledge the extensive contributions of collaborators, including Dr. Konfliktus, in several of his publications regarding bird habitat.
2.	Dr. Murky made inaccurate representations of some evidential recordings in his publications related to the reduction of bird diversity in a forest that had undergone clearcutting in the last year.
Dr. Murky had taken two separate recordings of the same forest one year before and after of the clearcutting. Dr. Konfliktus claimed, the recordings played by Dr. Murky in support of his findings in recorded interviews with Dr. Konfliktus were not the same what Dr. Murky used in his publication. Dr. Konfliktus claimed the probable falsification of the integrity of the research evidence done by Dr. Murky with the following circumstantial evidences,
1.	As stated earlier, Dr. Murky made an interview with Dr. Konfliktus regarding the source of the recordings. But Dr. Murky didn’t make any acknowledgement of Dr. Konfliktus in his publication.
2.	The recording that Dr. Murky has claimed to be taken before clearcutting contains a cacophonous mix of multiple bird songs, while there was hardly a noticeable sound of bird found in the second recording. The research was done about the reduction of bird diversity in a forest, not the extinction of the bird species. It brought Dr. Konfliktus’s concern about the integrity of Dr. Murky’s first recording.
3.	The second recording, that Dr. Murky used as the evidence of the impact of clearcutting contains a train whistle as a background noise. Dr. Konfliktus argued that this recording must be taken in different place rather claimed by Dr. Murky. As, the location Dr. Murky claimed where the recording took place, is too far away from railroad tracks and so it would not be possible that a train whistle may appear in the recording.
As part of the protocol, RIO has taken initial actions including placing a hold on all Dr. Murky’s electronic files and briefed Dr. Murky about the complaint against him. This inquiry committee has interviewed Dr. Konfliktus and Dr. Murky individually. 

In his interview, Dr. Murky did not able to provide the recordings and he claimed he misplaced those files recently. Dr. Murky was similarly unable to provide the RIO or the committee with the underlying research data and communications for the publications he had collaborated on with Dr. Konfliktus. He shared the map he had shared with the RIO, evidencing the proximity of the relevant location to train tracks, and he also shared videos of his interviews in which he discussed and played the now-missing recordings. Besides that, during his meeting with RIO, Dr. Murky accused the intention of Dr. Konfliktus’ concern about his research on reduction of bird diversity in a forest due to clearcutting. As, Dr. Konfliktus had recently received a grant from the timber company that was responsible for the clearcutting. Dr. Murky suspected that the company funded Dr. Konfliktus’ research in hopes of countering Dr. Murky’s findings, because the company has suffered severe PR setbacks in the community since Dr. Murky’s research was published.  Dr. Murky shared a copy of a newspaper article reporting substantial layoffs at the timber company.

During his interview, Dr. Konfliktus, confirmed that he had received a small grant from a timber company which was not responsible of the clearcutting that was the subject of Dr. Murky’s research. He shared the grant documents as the evidence. However, he also confirmed that the company that allocate Dr. Konfliktus as research grant, was interested in his evaluating the accuracy of Dr. Murky’s representations about the impact of clearcutting on forest species diversity.

#### Applicable Policies and Legal Standards
As part of this investigation, this inquiry committee have considered the following university policies:
1.	University Policy 308: Research relations with private enterprise and publication of research findings
2.	University Policy 309 & its supplemental procedures: Responding to allegations of misconduct in research and scholarship

#### Facts & Analysis
The complainant made allegations of (1) falsification of research data and (2) failing to provide proper acknowledgement of contributions of collaborators, against the Respondent. The complainant made allegations based on his observation and direct access to the research data during an interview session with the respondent.

Along with the RIO, this committee has conducted separate individual interviews with the respondent and the complainant. Though the RIO advised additional evidence, the respondent was failed to provide any strong supporting documents to this committee against the allegation upon him. However, the respondent shared a map locating the data collection place, and shared videos of the interviews with the compliant in which he discussed and played the currently missing recordings. The interview videos partially support the complaint’s claim of the involvement in the respondent’s research. However, the respondent failed to provide all publications in which he had collaborated with the complaint. Apart from this, another supporting document (e.g. the online map) cannot justify the integrity of the data collection.

On the other hand, during the interview with the complaint, this committee has received documents that nullify the respondent’s allegation against the complaint’s motive of this investigation. This evidence however neither supports nor nullifies the allegation against the respondent. This committee also queried to the complainant regarding the other parties who also didn’t receive acknowledgement of the collaboration from the respondent. The complaint however failed to give further evidence in this regard.
 
#### Recommendation(s)
The respondent fails to provide enough supporting evidence about the allegation. This inquiry committee found several places that needs further detailed investigation. The research data needs to be recovered before making any judgmental decision about this allegation. As it is outside the scope of this committee, we neither make any call to the corresponding publication authorities about the data, nor informed the university IT Office for recovering the misplaced files. This committee however recommend those action to be taken to retrieve the research data and justify the corresponding allegation for making the clear decision. This committee found enough evidence of the complainant’s communication to the respondent regarding the corresponding research. However, this committee didn’t able to confirm whether the respondent gave enough credits to the complaint in that related publication, as the respondent failed to provide all publications in which he had collaborated with the compliant. This committee thus recommend further investigation regarding this as well.

Based on the circumstantial evidences this inquiry committee believes that there is sufficient ambiguity to warrant further review pursuant to a research misconduct investigation.
